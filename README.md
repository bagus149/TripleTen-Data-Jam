# TripleTen-Data-Jam
Data Jam TripleTen is the data competition that unite all students from TripleTen programs to test our knowledge about data and how we apply it in the real case of data.

This is my project with my teammate Taruna. We got the 1st place of the competition. So, in this competition we choosed Life Expactancy as our dataset and the theme is Reshaping The Narative: Unveiling The Data of The World True Progress.

# Dataset
We took the data from Kaggle: [Life Expectancy WHO (Fixed)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated)
Data contains life expectancy, health, immunization, and economic and demographic information about 179 countries from 2000-2015 years. The adjusted dataset has 21 variables and 2.864 rows.

The dataset is completely updated.

Data about Population, GDP, and Life Expectancy was updated according to World Bank Data. Information about vaccinations for Measles, Hepatitis B, Polio, and Diphtheria, alcohol consumption, BMI, HIV incidents, mortality rates, and thinness were collected from World Health Organization public datasets. Information about Schooling was collected from the Our World in Data which is a project of the University of Oxford.
